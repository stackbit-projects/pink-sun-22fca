# Introduction

## **What is Blockchain**

Blockchain is a distributed network where every party on the network shares an identical copy of the database. Blockchain is essentially an immutable ledger which means that once data has been added to the Blockchain, it can never be deleted or tampered.

As the name suggests, it is a chain of blocks. All the transactions between two or more parties on a Blockchain network are recorded inside blocks that are cryptographically linked. Each block has a unique hash and includes a unique hash of the previous block.

A consensus protocol validates each transaction in Blockchain, which eradicates a third party's need.

To make Blockchain accessible to all, many organizations have come forward with their Blockchain protocols. Anyone can start building their Blockchain product by simply creating an application on top of a Blockchain platform. Each platform has its unique configuration and offerings. The most common factors that differentiate one Blockchain from another are Consensus algorithms, programming languages, Block configurations, type of Blockchain, cryptographic standards, hashing algorithms, and identity mapping, among other parameters.

One of the most popular permissioned private Blockchain platforms is Hyperledger Fabric.

## **Hyperledger Fabric**

Hyperledger Fabric is a Blockchain platform built for promoting enterprise adoption. Public networks such as bitcoin and Ethereum cannot accommodate enterprises' privacy and authorization needs which is why they have turned towards private Blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric.

In essence, Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned Blockchain. Anyone who wants to be a part of a Hyperledger Fabric network needs to be permitted to join it.

Contrary to other Blockchain platforms, Hyperledger Fabric gives complete control of the Blockchain to the developer. Hyperledger Fabric provides an outstanding flexibility level to the developers making it a perfect fit for many use-cases such as healthcare, supply chain, banking, insurance, and more.

The transaction architecture of Hyperledger Fabric is execute-order-validate. Every transaction that happens over a Hyperledger Fabric Network is executed, ordered in a sequence through the consensus protocol, and validated according to some predefined rules included in the endorsement policy. The transaction data is then added to the Blockchain ledger.

## **Catalyst Blockchain Platform**

Catalyst Blockchain Platform makes it possible for anyone, whether technical or non-technical, to create blockchain networks. It allows users to easily create complex, scalable, production-grade Blockchain applications with an advanced user interface and simplified process.

Some of the biggest hurdles in setting up a Hyperledger Fabric network are setting up the development environment, network configurations, and intensive programming for various purposes. However, with the Catalyst Blockchain Platform, you can add various components to your Hyperledger Fabric Network, configure those components, remove them, and easily create multiple scenarios with just a few clicks.

Whether adding new peers, creating a new channel, instantiating or installing chaincodes, or several other tasks, the Catalyst Blockchain Platform provides a seamless environment for all your activities on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network.

On the other hand, people who possess the technical expertise to manage entities on a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network are usually required to spend a tremendous amount of time on each activity. They have to work with several scripts and ensure they execute every single statement correctly for the whole network to perform optimally. The Catalyst Blockchain Platform allows such professionals to focus more on their use case by providing a powerful interface for managing their entities on a Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain network.

With Catalyst Blockchain Platform, creating or managing entities is just a few clicks away.
